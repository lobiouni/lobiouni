### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a freshwater ecologist passionate about data visualization and analysis. I started getting really interested in R programming language and statistics during my master's, and after much trial and error, I have been using R as a tool to communicate data and scientific findings effectively to the wider stakeholders involved. I am an assistant research scientist in the Horn Point Laboratory at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. My research directly addresses how earth-observing satellite data can better inform critical links between the biogeochemical and optical properties of inland waters. This NASA-funded project will help target chlorophyll hotspots to track cyanoHABs across the state of Missouri in the US.

I have a wide background in water quality, biodiversity conservation and monitoring programs. I completed my PhD at Santa Catarina Federal University in FlorianÃ³polis, Brazil studying the impact of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and the functioning of freshwater ecosystems. In my technique, I combine biomonitoring data and small-scale experiments, together with a wide variety and modern techniques for analyzing data, to better understand, predict and manage biodiversity responses to environmental change.
