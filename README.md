### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an ecologist passionate about data visualization and analysis. I started getting really interested in R programming language and statistics during my master's, and after much trial and error, I have been using R as a tool to communicate data and scientific findings effectively to the wider stakeholders involved. I am an assistant research scientist at the Horn Point Laboratory at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. My research directly addresses how earth-observing satellite data can better inform critical links between the biogeochemical and optical properties of inland waters. This NASA-funded project will help target chlorophyll hotspots to track cyanoHABs across the state of Missouri in the US.
